# Blocking-a-Malware-Backdoor
In this project, I will disable Windows Defender, leaving a server vulnerable. I will then simulate the accidental installation of malware and view the changes. I will take on the role of a pen tester and determine whether the malware was installed based on open network ports. Next, I will connect to the infected server, proving the ability to exploit it. Finally, in the role of security administrator, I will remove the malware.

Windows Defender is disabled.

Using Task Manager, I was able to find the malware which installed a backdoor application called netcat which runs with the privileges of the logged-on user  and allows a remote machine to access the command prompt .

 I then used a VM to run a posture assessment and see if the backdoor could be discovered using a network scanner called Angry IP scanner.

To connect to the backdoor, I used a terminal emulation client called PuTTY using a raw connection.

Using Task Manager and Windows Defender I investigated the changes that the Trojan had made, deleted the file and ended the task.

Using Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security, I was able to locate the inbound rule and disable it.

While his Trojan was trivially easy to block and remove, but most malware is more sophisticated.
